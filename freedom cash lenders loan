from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, 92% of adults who eat at sit-down restaurants say they always or frequently tip for the service. More than 70% say they tip for services such as a haircut and also for food delivery.

Tips are often provided in the context of person-to-person interactions. Someone brings your dinner, does your hair or serves your coffee, and you assume your tip goes directly to that person for their hard work.

With a cash advance app, it usually isn’t clear where the tip goes or whether it has an impact on the service, Saunders says.

“People may think that they have to tip to get the loan; they may think they won’t be able to borrow in the future if they don’t tip enough,” Saunders says. The apps "play on the psychology of ‘what will happen if I don’t tip?’”

Many apps’ terms and conditions say tipping isn’t a factor in determining eligibility or advance amount.
