That may be, in part, because of how apps request tips, says Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.

An app may set a default tip amount or show recommended percentages like your local coffee shop does. The screen may include a message about tips helping to keep the app in business or providing advances to more users.

Dave, another cash advance app, says on its website that part of the proceeds from tips help provide meals to families through a partnership with Feeding America. A Dave tipping screen shows an illustration of a little girl in pigtails. If the user tips, she’s shown smiling and surrounded by food. If the user sets the tip amount to $0, she’s replaced by an empty plate.
